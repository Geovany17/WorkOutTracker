## Description 

 The goal for this assignment is to create a full stack workout tracker web application that will allow a user to keep track of their workout regime by using MongoDB and Mongoose schema for database creation/management and Express for handling routes.
### README example

As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

  ### Demo for the deployed app
